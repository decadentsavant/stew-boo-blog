You're not the sum of those around you. It's a myth. A comforting lie for some.

Reality? You're the average of your five predominant thoughts. Thoughts sculpt identity. Identity seeks the like-minded.

Convinced you're a victim? Your crowd will be a chorus of woe.

But believe knowledge never ends? You'll find yourself in the company of mentors, experts, and enthusiasts.<br> 
Ruminate on fitness? Athletes will be your companions.<br>
View strangers as connections waiting to be made? You'll be a hub in a network of titans.<br>

You can't game this system by reverse-engineering it, placing yourself amidst prodigies and hoping their luster rubs off. It's not osmosis; it's alignment.

Stop outsourcing your outcomes in life to others. Focus on your predominant thoughts.
