Printing press said bye to scribes.

Mechanical reaper? "Peace, farm hands!"

Electricity? Lamplighters left on "read."

Digital streaming? Ghosted my Blockbuster buds (my teen gig).

Artificial intelligence? It's the "new" tool on the block. Some folks get benched.

Your move:

1\. Get AI-smart, keep your desk.<br>
2. Learn AI, snag someone else's desk.<br>
3. Cower under your desk...then job hunt. 

Regardless, the sun is going to come up tomorrow and "every little thing, gonna be all right."

So don't worry, about a thing.
