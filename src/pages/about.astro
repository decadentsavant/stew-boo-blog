            Corey Stewart was asked to join and launch the internal startup of
            Coaching in Organizations at the globally recognized International
            Coaching Federation (ICF).
        </p>

        <p>He is now it's Director of Operations.</p>

            day-to-day functions, ensuring that each cog in the organizational
            wheel spins without a hitch.
        </p>

        <p>
            Externally, he employs his strategic acumen by consulting for
            international enterprises of Fortune caliber, facilitating them in
            constructing, scaling, and fine-tuning their in-house coaching

            Personal Biography - long fun version
        </h3>

        <p>
            Alright folks, gather round and lets chew the fat about one Corey
            Stewart, our resident lifetime learner and action enthusiast.
        </p>

        <p>
            He emerges from the Texas sun as a classic Gen X'er, nourished on a
            balanced diet of BBQ, Nirvana, and life lessons from Saved by the
            Bell. He excels academically, albeit painfully shy. He's an Einstein
            at school, but he'd rather tackle a tax audit than a trivial chat.
        </p>

        <p>
            So at 18, off he goes to the University of Texas - Arlington, full
            academic scholarship in hand, but not a clue what to do. So he
            starts doing what turns out to be what he does best, asseses and
            acts...
        </p>

        <p>
            To shake off his shyness, he forces himself to peddle Dish Network
            door-to-door, joins a fraternity, and takes up rock climbing. Yah,
            yah, rock climbing. A real social butterfly, that one.
        </p>

        <p>It works.</p>

        <p>
            Post-college, he takes his first swing at interviewing for a job in
            logistics, but the HR team swoons over his charisma and asks him to
            join their team instead. He takes them up on the offer.
        </p>

        <p>
            Within a couple years, they ask him to move from Texas to
            <span class="italic font-bold">"Vegas, baby!"</span>
            to head up the HR department as they build a new 500,000 sq. ft. manufacturing
            facility. He starts as employee number five and before you know it, he
            brings in 100+ more employees.
        </p>

        <p>
            He's working 14 hour days, constantly in over his head, but he
            learns, adapts, and thrives.
        </p>

        <p>
            While primarily focusing on the HR job, he also begins moonlighting
            as a nightclub photographer, giving Vegas' party animals their 15
            minutes of fame. His 14 hour days turn into 18 hour days, and he's
            not sure if he's coming or going. But he's young; he can handle it.
        </p>

        <p>
            (Fun fact: One night he takes a photo that ultimately crashes an
            ESPN server during the MLB steroid debacle. Talk about a Kodak
            moment.)
        </p>

        <p>
            Eventually, the Lone Star state calls him home, and he clocks in a
            decade at GAF. He dives deeeep into the headlong depths of HR,
            Talent Management, and Organizational Development.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some aspects are fun...monumental mergers & acquisitions,
            subsequently centralizing talent management initiatives, and
            steering company-wide annual capability reviews.
        </p>

        <p>(Yes, that's fun to him.)</p>

        <p>
            Some of it wasn't so fun - union negotiaitons and arbitrations,
            testifying in federal court, and taking injured employees to the
            hospital at 4am.
        </p>

        <p>
            He experiences more as an HR / Talent Management / Organziational
            Development professional than most talent leaders will in two
            lifetimes. His life is a rollercoaster of adrenaline - like being in
            a Tom Cruise flick, but with less CGI and more paperwork.
        </p>

        <p>
            Amidst the chaos, he's taking annual sailing trips with friends
            learning to sail. They want to live on a boat someday and are asking
            him to join them, but he's scared of abandoning the security of a
            steady paycheck so he says no. Until the day he says yes.
        </p>

        <p>
            He sells everything and moves onto a 52' sailboat in Florida with
            only two dufflebags of clothes. They set sail for a 12 month
            adventure across Georgia, Florida, the Bahamas, Turks & Caicos, and
            the Dominican Republic.
        </p>

        <p>
            He learns to sail a little better, spearfish, cook lobster, ride a
            motorcycle on some pretty questionable roads, and hurricane prep a
            boat...for two hurricanes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Post-sailing, Corey sprouts wings and flies around the globe for 2
            more years. Along the way he hikes 14'ers, walks across the country
            of Spain, and runs a couple half marathons - he's like an Energizer
            bunny on steroids, but has narcolepsy too.
        </p>

        <p>
            (As an aside, he also marks Madeira, Portugal as his future
            retirement haven - or sooner if the opportunity affords itself. If
            you've got an "in" on a job/property/etc. to get him there, let him
            know! Seriously.)
        </p>

        <p>
            The three years affords him an education you can't find in any
            classroom or corporate boardroom. He learned firsthand the
            impermanence of comfort, the importance of resourcefulness, and the
            power of perseverance. But most importantly, he learned about
            himself - his strengths, his weaknesses, his fears, and his
            aspirations. A life less ordinary finally became his greatest
            teacher.
        </p>

        <p>But alas, the travel comes to an end...</p>

        <p>
            He had been freelancing all along as a photographer and video editor
            for a New Zealand fresh produce company, but decides to go back to
            work full-time in February of 2020. COVID deemed this timing less
            than ideal.
        </p>

        <p>
            But fortunately, he lands at the International Coaching Federation
            where he's working as of this writing.
        </p>

        <p>
            Presently, you can spot him teaching himself software development,
            running with his dog, and casting lines for largemouth bass,
            splitting his time between Texas and NYC.
        </p>

        <p>Because hey, life is a buffet, why not sample everything?</p>
