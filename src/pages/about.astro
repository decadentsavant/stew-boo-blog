		Personal Biography - long fun version
	</h3>

	<p>
		Alright folks, gather round and lets chew the fat about one Corey
		Stewart, our resident lifetime learner and action enthusiast.
	</p>

	<p>
		He emerges from the Texas sun as a classic Gen X'er, nourished on a
		balanced diet of BBQ, Nirvana, and life lessons from Saved by the Bell.
		He excels academically, but is painfully shy. He's an Einstein at
		school, but so shy he'd rather tackle a tax audit than a trivial chat.
	</p>

	<p>
		So at 18, off he goes to the University of Texas - Arlington on a full
		academic scholarship in pursuit of an accounting degree. And here's
		where our tale of constant learning and action begins...
	</p>

	<p>
		To shake off his shyness, he forces himself to peddle Dish Netowrk
		door-to-door, joins a fraternity, and takes up rock climbing. Yes, rock
		climbing. A real social butterfly, that one.
	</p>

	<p>
		Post-college, he takes a swing at a job in in logistics, but the HR team
		swoons over his charisma and asks him to join their team instead. He
		takes them up on the offer.
	</p>

	<p>
		Within a couple years, they ask him to move from Texas to <span
			class="italic font-bold">"Vegas, baby!"</span
		> to head up the HR department as they build a new 500,000 sq. ft. manufacturing
		facility. He starts as employee number five and before you know it, he brings
		in 100+ more employees.
	</p>

	<p>
		He's working 14 hour days and napping in his truck at lunch, but he
		learns, adapts, and thrives. And he's young.
	</p>

	<p>
		While juggling the HR gig, he begins moonlighting as a nightclub
		photographer, giving Vegas' party animals their 15 minutes of fame. His
		14 hour days turn into 18 hour days, and he's not sure if he's coming or
		going.
	</p>

	<p>
		One night he takes a fiery photo and it crashes an ESPN server during
		the MLB steroid debalce. Talk about a Kodak moment.
	</p>

	<p>
		Eventually, the Lone Star state calls him home, and Corey clocks a
		decade at GAF. He dives deep into the headlong depths of HR,
		Organizational Development, and Talent Management.
	</p>

	<p>
		Some aspects are fun...such as mergers & acquisitions, subsequently
		creating and centralizing Performance Mangement and Learning &
		Development processes, and steering company-wide annual capability
		reviews.
	</p>

	<p>Yes, that's fun to him.</p>

	<p>
		Some of it wasn't so fun - union negotiaitons and arbitrations,
		testifying in federal court, and taking injured employees to the
		hospital at 4am.
	</p>

	<p>
		He experiences more as an HR / Talent Management / Organziational
		Development professional than most will in two lifetimes. His life is a
		rollercoaster of adrenaline - it's like being in a Tom Cruise flick, but
		with less CGI and more paperwork.
	</p>

	<p>
		Amidst the chaos, he's taking annual sailing trips with friends learning
		to sail. They want to live on a boat someday and keep asking him to join
		them, but he's scared of abandoning the security of a steady paycheck
		behind so he says no. Until the day he says yes.
	</p>

	<p>
		He sells everything and moves onto a 52' sailboat in Florida with two
		dufflebags of clothes. They set sail for a 12 month adventrue across
		Georgia, Florida, the Bahamas, Turks & Caicos, and the Dominican
		Republic.
	</p>

	<p>
		It's an education you can't find in any classroom or corporate
		boardroom. He learns to sail a little more, spearfish, cook lobster,
		ride a motorcycle on some pretty questionable roads, and hurricane prep
		a boat...for two hurricanes.
	</p>

	<p>
		Post-sailing, Corey sprouts wings and flies around the globe for 2 more
		years. Along the way he hikes a 14'er, walks across the country of Spain, and runs a
		couple half marathons - he's like an Energizer bunny on steroids, but
		has narcolepsy too.
	</p>

	<p>
		He also marks Maderia, Portugal as his future retirement haven - or
		sooner if the opportunity affords itself. If you've got an "in" there,
		he's all ears.
	</p>

	<p>
		Freelancing all along as a photographer and video editor for a New
		Zealand fresh produce company finally comes to an end when he decides to
		go back to work in February of 2020. Obviously, this timing is not
		ideal.
	</p>

	<p>
		Fortunately, he lands at the International Coaching Federation where
		he's working as of this writing.
	</p>

	<p>
		Presently, you can spot him teaching himself software development,
		walking his dog, and casting lines for largemouth bass, splitting his
		time between Texas and NYC. Because hey, life is a buffet, why not
		sample everything?
